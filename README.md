## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [✓] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [✓] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [✓] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [✓] Split between a group of people. The number of people in group can be edited by either keyboard or button.

## Notes

Biggest challenge was debugging. Unlike command line tool I built before in other classes, the problem/bug in app development is harder to find since I'm not fimiliar with the app structure and meaning of error message.
